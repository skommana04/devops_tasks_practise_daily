‚úÖ Task 1: Linux ‚Äî Log Analysis & Filtering

Scenario: You are on-call and need to quickly extract useful info from logs.

Problem:
Given a log file (app.log), find:
a) The number of ERROR entries
    cat app.log | grep -i error | wc -l 
or
    grep -i error app.log

b) Top 5 IPs triggering the most requests
    cat app.log | awk -F " " '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -grk1 
c) Show last 20 log lines continuously (like tailing logs)
      tail -n 20 -f app.log


Create a dummy log file or use nginx access log if available.

üêç Task 2: Python ‚Äî Parse JSON & Generate a Report

Scenario: A DevOps tool returns JSON output (like aws cli, Prometheus, or Kubernetes response).
Write a Python script that:

Reads a servers.json file containing server names and CPU usage

Finds servers with CPU > 80%

Prints a summary report

Bonus: Output results to a CSV file.

Key DevOps skills tested: parsing JSON, basic automation, reporting.

üêö Task 3: Shell Scripting ‚Äî Monitor Disk Space & Send Alert

Write a shell script disk_alert.sh that:

Checks disk usage for /

If usage > 75%, prints a warning message

Logs the result to a file disk_alert.log with timestamp

Bonus:
Add email or Slack alert (just echo "would send alert" if email not set).

This is a classic DevOps SRE-style task.

üêß Task 4: Linux Permissions & Processes

Perform the following on your Linux machine:

Create a new user devuser

Give them permission to execute a script but not edit it

Run a process in the background and redirect logs to a file

View only that process in the process list

Skills this builds: chmod, chown, ps, top, nohup, &, > and 2>&1

‚òÅÔ∏è Task 5: Python + Bash ‚Äî Automate a Repetitive Task

Scenario: You deploy apps often and want a quick script to package logs.

Create a script using both Bash + Python:

Bash script to compress the /var/log directory into a .tar.gz file

Python script to upload the file to AWS S3
(If you don‚Äôt have AWS, simulate by copying to a ‚Äúbackup‚Äù folder)

This builds real DevOps automation thinking: Bash for OS tasks, Python for integrations.
